# Software
The Data Relay program interprets commands from the remote and relays instructions to VLC Media Player over a TCP port. It parses track and playback information from VLC and relays it to the Arduino over a serial connection.

The Arduino parses information from the Data Relay for display, as well as recognising inputs.
